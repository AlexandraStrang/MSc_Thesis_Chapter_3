# Chapter 3: Advancing efficiencies in remote sensing of Ross Sea Adélie penguin populations
A chapter belonging to my Master's Thesis submitted for the degree Master of Science at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. 

## Overview:
This chapter explored the use of Very High-Resolution satellite imagery (VHR) for monitoring Adélie penguin colonies in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica. The aim was to create a model that predicts the number of breeding pairs of Adélie penguins using the area of guano for four colonies in the Ross Sea.
